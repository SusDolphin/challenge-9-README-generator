# Professional README

## Description
This project is a versatile README Generator built using Java and Node.js. It is designed to automatically generate comprehensive and well-structured README files for software projects, saving time for developers and ensuring consistency across documentation.The generator prompts the user for various details about the project, such as its name, description, installation steps, usage instructions, and more. Based on these inputs, it then constructs a professional README template that can be used directly in any project.
